class SmeetsHooge(EventStream):
	"""A velocity threshold-based algorithm, based on "Nature of Variability
	   in Saccades" by Smeets and Hooge (2003).
		 
	   This algorithm by default does no filtering of input streams.
	   Use one of the other filter modules to provide custom filtering behaviour 
	   prior to applying this event detector.  This is particularly important
	   owing to the use of peak velocity as a measure in this algorithm.
	   The use of a parabolic curve-fitting filter is suggested in the original
	   paper, specifically fitting through groups of 3 subsequent points to
	   estimate the velocity at sample n.

	   The baseline window is defined by two parameters:
	     * How far in the past to start the window before saccade onset.
	     * How many samples to use.

	   For example, if the velocity threshold is crossed at sample t,
	   we would need to seek back to sample t - (n + m) samples to find the
	   start of the sampling window, and then take the average of the samples in
	   the range t - (n + m) ... (t - n) as the baseline velocity with which to
	   calculate saccade onset and offset (the saccade onset is when it reaches
	   3 standard deviations beyond this mean).

	   Note that this algorithm is completely offline.  It needs to be able to
	   seek forward and back arbitrary amounts, therefore it is implemented
	   as a single buffered pass over the input stream.  An online variant
	   is possible, but it is not implemented here for simplicity.

	   Parameters:
		velThresh (pixels/s) The velocity above which to mark a possible saccade.
		windowOffset: The number of samples before the threshold crossing to sample.
		windowSize: the size of the baseline window (in samples).
